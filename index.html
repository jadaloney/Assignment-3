                  	<td>SZA's first official album, 'Z,' released in 2014, is the most recent addition to my discography. My 
favourite tracks from this album include 'Sweet 
November' and 'Omega.' The artwork for SZA’s album Z is my favourite out of all of the albums. The 
colours are really pretty and the style is extremly 
aesthetically pleasing to me. I am a big fan of the 1800s Regency period and this album cover is a modern twist to that aesthetic. I love most, to all, 
content SZA creates. She could realse a song that is 10 mintues of silence and I would add its own page to this website dedicated to it.</td>

                  <td>SZA's album “Crtl” was the album that introduced me to her music. My all time favourite SZA song is on this album and was the song that started my whole SZA admiration. The song is called “Supermodel”. I 
absolutely love the sound of this album. Each song is a stand alone banger and the cover is so inspiring on a 
creative level. Although I know all the words to this whole album and love ALL the songs on this album, my top songs right now in rank order are “Supermodel”, “Prom”, “20 Something”, “Go Gina”, and “Drew 
Barrymore”.</td>
